The purpose of this doucment is to provide more details that the [IBM APIC command-line tool reference document](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/api-connect/10.0.1.x?topic=information-toolkit-command-line-tool-reference) does not provide (e.g. dependent commands which are required to get proper responses from other toolkit calls).  

Please see the wiki section for [APIC Toolkit Reference documentation](https://github.com/ibmArtifacts/APIC_Toolkit_Reference/wiki/APIC-Toolkit-Reference).  

NOTE: The order of the toolkit commands provided may serve as an automation deployment after APIC infrastructure deployment.
